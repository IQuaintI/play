          Learning land navigation seems like a strange thing to do in a world
          where we have pinpoint accurate GPS only a few taps a way, but there
          is still something to be said for the old-school ways of doing things.
          You will not always have signal, or battery life, or even electronics
          on you, but you will always have your wits about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A map is a graphic representation of the Earth's surface drawn to
          scale from an overhead view. If that sounded complicated do not worry.
          This techinical document will go over some of the basics of land
          navigation.

          The only things you need to be succesful at land navigation is a map,
          a compass, a protracter, a writing utensil, and some luck.

          ever need to know regarding the matter.

          Ever wonder what all those colors on a map mean? Well have no fear as
          the following will hopefully answer every question you had on the
          matter.

          Red represents cultural features such as populated areas, roads, and
          boundaries. However, this color is only found on older maps as it has
          been superseded by the red-brown color.
        </p>

        <header class="logo" id="brown">Brown</header>
        <p>
          Brown is next up on our color wheel and it represents all relief
          features (this is just a fancy way of saying terrain), differences in
          elevation through contour lines, cultivated land and is readable when
          using a red-light.
        </p>
        <p>This color is also used more so on older maps.</p>
        <li>
          “The color brown, I realized, is anything but nondescript. It comes in
          as many hues as there are colors of earth, with is commonly presumed
          infinite.” ― Barbara Kingsolver

          A mixture of two colors that exist to identify cultural features
          (human-made features), relief features, non-surveyed elevations, and
          surveyed elevations.

          woods, orchards, and vineyards.

        <p>Maps tend to have a lot of this.</p>

        <p>
          This color represents hydrography (measuring the physical features of
          water) or other water features such as lakes, swamps, rivers, and
          drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while maps can show how big a body of water is, it does not
          accurately portray depth.

          Identifies man-made features such as buildings, roads, surveyed spots
          and all labels.

        <p>
          This color is similar to red-brown but cannot be seen with a
          red-light.
