          Learning land navigation seems like a strange thing to do in a world
          where we have the entirety of the world only a few taps a way, but
          there is still something to be said for the old-school ways of doing
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry. Maps rading may seem difficult but maps are nothing more
          than a graphic representation of the Earth's surface drawn to scale
          from an overhead view. This techinical document will go over some of
          the basics of land navigation.

          The only things you need to be succesful at land navigation is a map,
          a compass, a protracter, a writing utensil, and some luck.

          If you want any more information on land navigation Army Field
          Manual/Training Circular (FM/TC) 3-25.26 covers everything you will
          ever need to know regarding the matter.

          Ever wonder what all those colors on a map mean? Well have no fear as
          the following will hopefully go answer every question you had on the
          matter.

          Red represents cultural features such as populated areas, roads, and
          boundaries. However, this color is only found on older maps as it has
          been superseded by the red-brown color.

        <header class="logo">Brown</header>
        <p>
          Brown is next up on our color wheel and it represents all relief
          features (this is just a fancy way of saying terrain) and differences
          in elevation through contour lines. It also shows cuitvated land on
          when using a red-light readable map.
        </p>
        <p>This color is also used more so on older maps.</p>
        <li>
          “The color brown, I realized, is anything but nondescript. It comes in
          as many hues as there are colors of earth, with is commonly presumed
          infinite.” ― Barbara Kingsolver

          A mixture of two colors that exist to identify cultural features
          (human-made features), relief features, non-surveyed spot elavations,
          and surveyed elavation.

          Makes note of vegetation that carries military significance such as
          woods, orchards, and vineyards.

        <p>Maps tend to have a lot of this.</p>

          “If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, doesn't
          it just lie there and rot?” ― Chuck Palahniuk

      <section class="main-section">
        <header class="logo">Blue</header>
        <p>
          This color represents hydrography (measuring the physical features of
          water) or other water features such as lakes, swamps, rivers, and
          drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while maps can show how big a body of water is, it does not
          accurately portray depth.
